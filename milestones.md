### Milestones: Augmenting Masterpieces

**Overall Objective:** Combine theoretical and practical research by using Design Thinking and other creative methods. Ideate, prototype and test one way of technical interaction for a specific visitor of the Rijksmuseum.
 
**Objective:** Investigating possible interfaces for the Rijksmuseum which enable the visitor to engage in a different way with the physical collection of the museum.

Here is the list of Milestones that I am working towards. The bulletpoints describe how the milestones were met.

*1. Project website and git repository in order to display the research process to a wider audience*
  * www.augmentingmasterpieces.nl
  * concept, graphics, texts and embedding of the project
  * https://github.com/JBarnbeck/Augmenting-Masterpieces/


*2. Expert meeting between university and museum*
  * Medialab Rijksmuseum January 30th 2014 
  * receive and discuss actionable feedback from public and private parties involved


*3. Empathize with the visitors and staff of the museum & define single user*
  * User Camera Study
  * Observations visualised in sketches, maps, film sequences and photographs
  * User Interviews (differen visitor types, curators, security, museum guides)
  * Written Summary


*4. Identify spaces for interfaces within the museum*
  * Concept of unused spaces, unused time and usable passageways and objects
  * 
  

*5. Reflect on the role of the embedded researcher within the university*
  *  Idea and written concept for an interdisciplinary, multi-medial lab for Embedded Researchers 
  *  Develop further self-reflexive methodology and the implementation of design thinking


*6. Create sustainable collaborations in which this project continues (search and integrate in funding opportunities with a longterm scope)*
 * Contribution to funding applications by the UvA with a focus on setting up a physcial and digital environment for embedded research at the Uva

*7. make a Scientific Research Trailer*


*8. Ideate a (paper) prototype*


*9. Reflect on building prototype*


*10. Reflect on testing the prototype*


*11. acquire technical knowledge to refine from paper prototype to technical prototype*


*12. present the findings and prototype in appropriate manner to stakeholders of the project*


*13. publish findings of the project together with applicants*
